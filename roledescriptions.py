There is no man, beast or god who can resist the seductive allure of the reaper's scythe and there is nothing to ever come back from it. We must all concede inevitably - we have no say in if we die, but we do have a say in how. Whether in a blaze of glory or a wave of the blood of our enemies, we must all accept that there's no magical guardian out there to save us from it. Such a fantasy would be... ridiculous.*

I also really wonder if the TARDIS saved their planet of origin so I can get some more.*
**Actions:**
*Activate TARDIS* - Once per game, during the day, can choose to activate the TARDIS. At that same point in the next day (based around elections and lynchings), the whole town is told that time has been undone and the game goes back to the point when the TARDIS was activated. Any uses of actions and kills after that point are undone, however all knowledge gained remains known. The game continues from the TARDIS activation point. If the TARDIS Engineer’s role changes before time is undone, this action still takes effect.
**Abilities:**
- If they lose the Companion modifier, they become an Inventor, however they keep the alignment and objective they had as a TARDIS Engineer.

**Actions:**
*Steal* - Once every 3 nights, can choose any player. If that player is Good or Evil, one of their actions is randomly chosen. The Thief gains access to that action for the rest of the game, and that player may not use that action for the rest of the game. Both the target player and the Thief are told this. There is no effect if the target of this action is Neutral. If the target was Neutral, the Thief may try again on the following night.
**Abilities:**
- If they become Evil, they become a Dodomeki.
- Upon death or changing role, all actions taken using *Steal* are returned to the players they were stolen from, even if those players' roles have changed since the action was stolen.
- When using *Visit Merchant*, the Thief does not lose an action.

**Actions:**
*Invite* - Once per game (regaining a use if the action fails), at night, may choose another player to gain the Companion modifer. This Companion joins the Time Lord’s channel. After the Time Lord regenerates, the Companion loses their Companion modifier. They also lose the modifier if they die or their alignment changes. If a player who already has the Companion modifier is targeted with *Invite*, or a player is targeted with *Invite* by two Time Lords of the same alignment on the same night, they become a TARDIS Engineer. If two Time Lords of different alignments target the same player with *Invite*, both actions fail, however the use of *Invite* is still used up.
*Sonic* - Once per game, may use their sonic device to retrieve a list of roles. The amount of roles given will be equal to the amount of players and at least half of the list, rounding up, will be present in the game. Which roles are chosen is randomly determined.
**Abilities:**
- Starts the game with a Queued Unstoppable Save called a regeneration. When this Save is used, the Time Lord’s alignment changes to Good or Evil, whichever of the two has less living players not including the Time Lord. If they are equal in size, the Time Lord changes to the opposite alignment. The Time Lord gains another use of *Invite*. In addition, the town is told that a Time Lord has regenerated, and their alignment after the regeneration.

**Abilities:**

**Actions:**
*Fangs* - Every two nights, all Vampires together may target any player. That player loses all of their saves. If that player had no saves, they become a Vampire. If the player targeted had also been targeted with Infect that night, was a Werewolf or had the Feral modifier, they become a Bloodhound rather than a Vampire.
*Stalk* - Once per game, at night, may choose to learn the identity of a random Wolf. 
**Abilities:**
- All Vampires and Bloodhounds in the game may speak in a collective private channel with one another. They may still speak in this channel after death.
- Whenever any player (other than one who was already a Vampire) becomes a Vampire or a Bloodhound, all Vampires and Bloodhounds other than that player gain a Queued Standard Save.
- If targeted by any effect that would cause an alignment change without changing the Vampire's role, commits Suicide.
