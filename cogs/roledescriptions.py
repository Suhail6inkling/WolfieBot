**Actions:**
*Scrub* - Once per game, at night, may choose a player. If that player gains any saves during that night, they are targeted with two Standard attacks.
*Tidy Up* - Once per game, at night, may choose a player. If that player is targeted with any attack that night, regardless of if that attack is saved against, they commit Suicide.
*Spring Cleaning* - Once per game, at night, the following night, the player given the secondmost amount of votes in the Lynch the previous day commits Suicide (the Maid can choose which player in the event of any relevant ties).
**Abilities:**
- Cannot change alignment or objective by any means, unless they also change role. If an effect would cause the Maid to change their alignment or objective without also changing their role, it fails.
- If killed, all players who have a condition that would allow them to become an Achievable role in their abilities automatically have that condition count as being fulfilled. In the event that they have multiple, one is randomly chosen.
- Does not need to be eliminated to fulfill any player's objectives.
**Objectives:**
- Have every player alive at the start of DAY 4 (not including themselves) be in the Winning Players. Any player who commits Suicide after the start of DAY 4 does not count to this. If the game ends before DAY 4, the Maid loses.

- Commits Suicide on NIGHT 1, and appears to be a random Good Human role when dead. They are given the names of three players, randomly chosen; one Good, one Evil and one Neutral (providing there is another Neutral in the game; otherwise only two names are given). At the start of DAY 3, they are resurrected. They gain the role, alignment and modifiers of one of the players whose names they were given. They also gain all the Saves that player has at the moment the Rōjinbi is resurrected. If the player has died before that point, the Rōjinbi is still resurrected, however they gain no Saves. The player is decided using the following method: If the Direwolf is alive, then Evil. Otherwise, if the Seer is alive, then Good. If neither are alive, then Neutral (unless the Rōjinbi did not recieve the name of a Neutral player, in which case Good).

**Actions:**
*Steal* - Once every 3 nights, can choose any player. If that player is Good or Evil, one of their actions is randomly chosen. The Thief gains access to that action for the rest of the game, and that player may not use that action for the rest of the game. Both the target player and the Thief are told this. There is no effect if the target of this action is Neutral. If the target was Neutral, the Thief may try again on the following night.
**Abilities:**
- If they become Evil, they become a Dodomeki.
- Upon death or changing role, all actions taken using *Steal* are returned to the players they were stolen from, even if those players' roles have changed since the action was stolen.
- When using *Visit Merchant*, the Thief does not lose an action.
**Objectives:**
- Be the last player alive, or finish the game with no living players.

**Actions:**
*Invite* - Once per game (regaining a use if the action fails), at night, may choose another player to gain the Companion modifer. This Companion joins the Time Lord’s channel. After the Time Lord regenerates, the Companion loses their Companion modifier. They also lose the modifier if they die or their alignment changes. If a player who already has the Companion modifier is targeted with *Invite*, or a player is targeted with *Invite* by two Time Lords of the same alignment on the same night, they become a TARDIS Engineer. If two Time Lords of different alignments target the same player with *Invite*, both actions fail, however the use of *Invite* is still used up.
*Sonic* - Once per game, may use their sonic device to retrieve a list of roles. The amount of roles given will be equal to the amount of players and at least half of the list, rounding up, will be present in the game. Which roles are chosen is randomly determined.
**Abilities:**
- Starts the game with a Queued Unstoppable Save called a regeneration. When this Save is used, the Time Lord’s alignment changes to Good or Evil, whichever of the two has less living players not including the Time Lord. If they are equal in size, the Time Lord changes to the opposite alignment. The Time Lord gains another use of *Invite*. In addition, the town is told that a Time Lord has regenerated, and their alignment after the regeneration.
**Objectives:**
- Have at least one Good role survive until all Evil and Neutral roles have been eliminated (If Good).

**Abilities:**
- This Modifier is always applied to a pair of players.
- The Twins may speak in a shared channel with one another at any time.
- Upon becoming Twins, choose together the alignment and objectives of one of them to be applied to the other. If one’s alignment and objectives change, the other’s change too to be the same. If one's objectives change to 'be the last player alive', then it instead becomes 'have yourself and your Twin be the last players alive'.
- If one Twin is in the winning players, the other Twin is also.

- If one Twin is resurrected, the other is also resurrected.

**Actions:**
*Fangs* - Every two nights, all Vampires together may target any player. That player loses all of their saves. If that player had no saves, they become a Vampire. If the player targeted had also been targeted with Infect that night, was a Werewolf or had the Feral modifier, they become a Bloodhound rather than a Vampire.
*Stalk* - Once per game, at night, may choose to learn the identity of a random Wolf. 
**Abilities:**
- All Vampires and Bloodhounds in the game may speak in a collective private channel with one another. They may still speak in this channel after death.
- Whenever any player (other than one who was already a Vampire) becomes a Vampire or a Bloodhound, all Vampires and Bloodhounds other than that player gain a Queued Standard Save.
- If targeted by any effect that would cause an alignment change without changing the Vampire's role, commits Suicide.

**Actions:**
*Damn* - Twice per game, at night, may choose a player to damn. The damned player and all players targeting them (if targeted by Wolves a random Wolf is chosen) apart from the Warlock are targeted with a Powerful Attack.
*Hell's Gate* - Once per game, may target one player. All actions that player makes on the night this action is used fails if they specifically target a Priest, Paladin, Cultist or Warlock.
